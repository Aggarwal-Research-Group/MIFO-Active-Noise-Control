# MIFO-Active-Noise-Control
Any code, plots, files, and information that is useful and pertains to the active noise control of a Michelson Interferometer(MIFO).

The noise control of the MIFO is achieved with a piezoelectric actuactor that controls one arm length of the MIFO. The goal is to bring the output of the MIFO into and out of phase such that it cancels out the vibrations caused by mechanical vibrations.
